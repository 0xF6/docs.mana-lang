## Overview

The Mana Runtime module APIs define the base of the Mana language. 
These APIs include:

- Types such as the [Object](./api/Object) class and the [ValueType](./api/ValueType) protocol that provide the root functionality of most Mana classes.
- Functions and data structures that comprise the Mana runtime, which provides support for the dynamic properties of the Mana language.

You typically don't need to use this module directly.


The Mana runtime is a runtime library that provides support for the dynamic properties of the Mana language, and as such is linked to by all Mana apps.
